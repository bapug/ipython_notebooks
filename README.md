# Introduction #

Welcome to the Boise Python and Django Users Group Repo

Here we will assemble notes, information, examples, and other fun stuff. We welcome participation from all over, and encourage sharing. Come Django (rhymes with tango) with us!


# Getting Started #

I am going to assume you have a working Python installation of version 2.6+. Version 2.7 is the latest of the 2.x line, and highly recommended. 

If you are on a system that does not have Python at all, start here:

* https://www.python.org/download/

Most of what I do assumes a linux or unix system. All of this works on a Windows machine, but you will have to resolve a few issues on your own. The biggest 'disconnect' is that you will need to resolve the lack of a decent shell. PowerShell is the best solution for Windows as far as I know. Here is a reference to get you started.

The rest of this documnt will assume *nix, which includes Linux, Unix, or Mac operating systems.

## Setup a virtualenv

I highly recommend you get virtualenv wrapper setup.

* http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

From there, create a virtualenv and enable it.


> mkvirtualenv boisepython

## Install iPython and notebooks

> pip install ipython[all]

## Clone the git repository

> git clone git@github.com:boise-python-django-users/ipython_notebooks.git


There you go.. your ready to play!
